          Gbenga Eyiolawi, (a Chartered Manager with the Chartered Management Institute, United Kingdom)
           born on November 7, 1987, is a transformative Nigerian serial entrepreneur and visionary leader
            known for his groundbreaking contributions across multiple sectors, including AgriTech and PropTech. 

            As the founder of Hybrid Improvements and Services, with presence on 3 continents, 
            he has made significant strides in operational excellence and strategic business transformations.

            His experience in FoodTech, Continuous Improvement and Production Management set him on a path
             to building Food Hybrid, a food processing business leveraging technology for the production 
             and distribution of African staple foods of Nigerian origin across the world, a business he 
             heads as Founder & CEO.

          </p>
          <p>
          Gbenga‚Äôs journey is as remarkable as it is inspiring. Raised in Osogbo and spending his formative
           years in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, his entrepreneurial spirit emerged early. At just 13, he began trading
            and hawking goods, quickly becoming known as "Baba- Leku," the herbal maestro, for his role in 
            connecting wholesale herbal merchants with local retailers. This early experience laid the 
            foundation for his future success.

          </p>
          <p>
          Despite facing numerous challenges, Gbenga's resilience and 
          adaptability propelled him from humble beginnings to become 
          a respected leader in the corporate world. His path was marked
          by personal sacrifices and a relentless drive to turn setbacks 
          into opportunities for growth. His journey from a young street 
          trader to a distinguished professional in boardrooms and consulting 
          roles is a testament to his unyielding determination.
          <p>
             Speaking about the role of women and Youth in business at the United 
          Nations Economic Commision for Africa is a testatment to the effort
          he has put into his craft.

           in 2015 and followed this with a Master of Business Administration (MBA)

            best known for his transformative work through Titan Farms and its flagship product,

            significantly contributed to food security and economic empowerment in Nigeria. 
            The success of Titan Farms drew widespread attention from various sectors, including

            To celebrate the farm‚Äôs success, Titan Farms organised a National Food Sustainability 
            Summit during its anniversary, bringing together stakeholders from across Nigeria. 
            The event featured lawmakers from both state and federal levels, alongside a prestigious
