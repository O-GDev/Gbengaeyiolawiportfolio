          Gbenga Eyiolawi, (a Chartered Manager with the Chartered 
          Management Institute, United Kingdom) born on November 7,
          1987, is a transformative Nigerian serial entrepreneur and 
          visionary leader known for his groundbreaking contributions
          across multiple sectors, including FinTech, AgriTech, and
          PropTech. As the founder of Hybrid Improvements and Services,

          in operational excellence and strategic business 
          transformations.
          </p>
          <p>
          Gbenga’s journey is as remarkable as it is inspiring. Raised in
          Osogbo and spending his formative years in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, his
          entrepreneurial spirit emerged early. At just 13, he began 
          trading and hawking goods, quickly becoming known as "Baba-
          Leku," the herbal maestro, for his role in connecting wholesale
          herbal merchants with local retailers. This early experience laid 
          the foundation for his future success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite facing numerous challenges, Gbenga's resilience and 
            adaptability propelled him from humble beginnings to become 
            a respected leader in the corporate world. His path was marked
            by personal sacrifices and a relentless drive to turn setbacks into 
            opportunities for growth. His journey from a young street trader
            to a distinguished professional in boardrooms and consulting 
            roles is a testament to his unyielding determination.
          </p>
          <p>
           Gbenga's academic journey began at Obafemi Awolowo 
            University, Ile-Ife, where he pursued Chemical Engineering
            before his love for business altered his path. He later obtained a 
            Bachelor's degree in Business Administration in 2015 and 
            followed this with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) 
            from Espam Formation University in 2018. His academic
            achievements culminated in an honorary Doctor of Science
            (D.Sc) degree in Entrepreneurship and Agricultural
            Development from European American University in the
            Commonwealth of Dominica.

                business intelligence tools like Power BI and Data Pine to ensure 
                insightful decision-making.
              </p>
              <p>
              In 2013, Gbenga expanded his entrepreneurial ventures by 
              launching Knack International, an ICT company focused on 
              providing cutting-edge technology solutions and consultancy 
              services. Under his leadership, Knack International quickly 
              established itself as a key player in the tech industry by 
              producing Tablet PCs and mobile phones, delivering innovative
              solutions and fostering digital transformation across various
              sectors.

               <p>
               In 2017, Gbenga made headlines with the launch of Peg & Red 
               Casuals, a fashion business that combines contemporary design 
               with traditional craftsmanship. In an interview about Peg & Red,

               functionality, aiming to create stylish yet practical clothing
               options for diverse audiences. The fashion venture reflects his
               commitment to innovation and excellence in all his business 
               endeavours. He emphasised that it is never too late to start
               business. (Punch Newspaper)

            Southwest Nigeria, best known for his transformative work 
            through Titan Farms and its flagship product, Titan Rice which

            its high quality and local production, which significantly 
            contributed to food security and economic empowerment in

            the agricultural industry.
